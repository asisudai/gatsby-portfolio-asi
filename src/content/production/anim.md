### *“I would like to make a film to tell children "it's good to be alive"”*
<p class="quotation">― Hayao Miyazaki</p>

<p class="message">
The animation team wants to bring the characters to life and play. A good pipeline let's them use their time to tell the character's story as apposed to dealing with  the technical steps.

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Create rigs that are fun and expressive.
- Keep the rigs light and fast or use LODs.
- Rigs are never perfect, animation should be able to correct shapes.
- Automate caches once animation-take is approve. No need to re-open scene-file.
- Separate creative approval and technical approval steps.
- GPU rendering to QC the shots before lighting.
