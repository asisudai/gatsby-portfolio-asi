## *"The spice must flow"*

The pipeline team continuously stream-line common tasks while making harder tasks doable. Finding stable and flexible solutions is key.

- Keeps track of (almost) every asset and file in production.
- Track reported bugs and even not-yet-reported ([sentry.io](https://sentry.io)).
- Code = [Control-Review (gitlab)](http://gitlab.com/) / [Unittest (pytest)](http://docs.pytest.org) / [Package Deployment (rez)](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez).
