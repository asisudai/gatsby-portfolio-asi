### *“The spice must flow”*
<p class="quotation">― Dune by Frank Herbert</p>

<p class="message">
The pipeline team continuously work to stream-line common-tasks while making other more complex-tasks doable. Finding stable and flexible solutions is key so we can keep building layers of solutions as the pipeline grows and expend.

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Use [Agile development methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) for short&clear development cycles.
- Share Pipeline's task and priorities with everyone. Transparency counts.
- Track reported and not-yet-reported bugs ([sentry.io](https://sentry.io)).
- Collect metrics of used tools and issues. This data helps making choices.
- Code review and unittest counts! [Control-Review (gitlab)](http://gitlab.com/) / [Unittest (pytest)](http://docs.pytest.org).
- Package deployment to buffer changes [Package Deployment (rez)](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez).
