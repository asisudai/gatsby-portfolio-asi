**Challenges and Solutions**
- Constantly updating assets without breaking downstream, using approval steps.
- Modular-framework for working with large environments such as [Pixar's USD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html).
- Clear tracking of asset/version and their Episode/Sequences/Shots.
- One publish interface to generate all LOD for an asset.
- Understand the asset needs right from the previs stage.
