### *“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that".”*
<p class="quotation">― Martin Luther King</p>

The lighting, compositing and rendering team are all about the race to the finish line. Been on the end of the production, so often they get the "growing pain" of all the departments before them.


**Challenges and Solutions**
- Keep the scenes light&fast to load. Using proxies and cached data.
- Publish/Load lighting and compositing templates.
- [GPU rendering](https://www.redshift3d.com/) to allow more iterations.
- Robust and scalable [farm](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) that can cycle the jobs in a timely manner.
- [Collect data and monitor](http://www.grafana.com) the farm to know where to improve.
- Help artists reduce render time and optimize render-time.
