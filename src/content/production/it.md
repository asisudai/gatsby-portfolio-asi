#### *“Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me”*
<p class="quotation">― The Office</p>

The pipeline team continuously work to stream-line common-tasks while making other more complex-tasks doable. Finding stable and flexible solutions is key so we can keep building layers of solutions as the pipeline grows and expend.

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Keep track of [disk-space](https://shirosaidev.github.io/diskover/) and the context/usage of each file and folder.
- [Monitor the health](https://grafana.com/) of the infrastructure. [Alert](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) when things go down.
- Keep track over usage of licenses and other resources throughout the day.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for lightweight services makes for easy maintenance and upgrades.
