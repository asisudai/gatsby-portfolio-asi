### *“If you type ‘Google’ into Google, you can break the internet.”*
<p class="quotation">― The IT Crowd</p>

<p class="message">
The IT team goal is to keep the server and services working - 99.9% of the time. IT challenges are balancing management and deployment of hardware&software, storage, security, high-availability servers, hardware evaluation and budget.</p>

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Keep track of [disk-space](https://shirosaidev.github.io/diskover/) and the context/usage of each file and folder.
- [Monitor the health](https://grafana.com/) of the infrastructure. [Alert](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) when things go down.
- Keep track over usage of licenses and other resources throughout the day.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for lightweight services makes for easy maintenance and upgrades.
